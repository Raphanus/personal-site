        <p>Social behaviors is a phenomenon that constantly grabs my attention, and underlies my interest in web and app development. Without an understanding of social behaviors, it becomes near impossible to find a niche that an app can fill. I graduated from Brown University in 2013 with a Bachelor of Sciences in Computational Biology. Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Sciences in Computer Science at Columbia University to further enhance my interests. My international work
        experience revealed another dimension to my meticulous study and application of concepts that were once foreign to me. Adaptability is key in an industry that is ever-changing; so, tackling back-end logic and front-end design gives me enough space to remain versatile and produce innovative outcomes.</p>

        <p>Outside of web and app development, I feed my creativity through piano performances and digital art. Team-based activities, such as basketball and competitive video gaming, instill discipline and cooperation. As a well-balanced, curious, and driven developer, I will continue to position myself for future successes and seek breakthroughs in the web app industry. </p>
